# BTextView

## Constructor and Destructor

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} BTextView::BTextView(BRect frame, const char* name, BRect textRect, uint32 resizingMode, uint32 flags)
:::

:::{cpp:function} BTextView::BTextView(BRect frame, const char* name, BRect textRect, const BFont* font, const rgb_color* color, uint32 resizingMode, uint32 flags)
:::

:::{cpp:function} BTextView::BTextView(BMessage* archive)
:::

Initializes the {hclass}`BTextView` to the {hparam}`frame` rectangle,
stated in its eventual parent's coordinate system, assigns it an
identifying {hparam}`name`, sets its resizing behavior to
{hparam}`resizingMode` and its drawing behavior with {hparam}`flags`. These
four arguments—{hparam}`frame`, {hparam}`name`, {hparam}`resizingMode`, and
{hparam}`flags`—are identical to those declared for the {cpp:class}`BView`
class and are passed to the {cpp:class}`BView` {cpp:func}`constructor
<BView::BView()>`. The {hparam}`frame`, {hparam}`name`, and
{hparam}`resizingMode` arguments are passed to the {cpp:class}`BView` class
unchanged, but two flags are added to the flags
argument—{cpp:enumerator}`B_FRAME_EVENTS`, so that the {hclass}`BTextView`
can reformat the text when it's resized, and
{cpp:enumerator}`B_PULSE_NEEDED`, so that the caret marking the insertion
point can "blink" in time with {cpp:enumerator}`B_PULSE` messages. Later,
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::AttachedToWindow()` will set the window's pulse rate
to 500,000 microseconds.

The text rectangle, {hparam}`textRect`, is stated in the
{hclass}`BTextView`'s coordinate system. It determines where text in placed
within the view's bounds rectangle:

- The first line of text is placed at the top of the text rectangle. As
  additional lines of text are entered into the view, the text grows
  downward and may actually extend beyond the bottom of the rectangle.

- The left and right sides of the text rectangle determine where lines of
  text are placed within the view. Lines can be aligned to either side of
  the rectangle, or they can be centered between the two sides. See the
  {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetAlignment()` function.

- When lines wrap on word boundaries, the width of the text rectangle
  determines the maximum length of a line; each line of text can be as long
  as the rectangle is wide. When word wrapping isn't turned on, lines can
  extend beyond the boundaries of the text rectangle. See the
  {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetWordWrap()` function.

The bottom of the text rectangle is ignored; it doesn't limit the amount of
text the view can contain. The text can be limited by the number of
characters, but not by the number of lines.

If a default font is provided, the {hclass}`BTextView` will display its
text in that font, unless another font is later set. Similarly, if a
default color is specified, the text will be displayed in that color,
unless the color is subsequently changed. If the font is {cpp:expr}`NULL`
or not specified, the {hclass}`BTextView` uses the system plain font,
{hparam}`be_plain_font`. If the color pointer is {cpp:expr}`NULL` or not
specified, the text is drawn in black.

The constructor establishes the following default properties for a new
{hclass}`BTextView`:

- The text is selectable and editable. (See
  {cpp:func}`~BTextView::MakeSelectable()` and
  {cpp:func}`~BTextView::MakeEditable()`.)

- Multiple character formats are not permitted. (See
  {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetStylable()`.)

- The text is left-aligned. (See {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetAlignment()`.)

- The tab width is 28.0 coordinate units. (See
  {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetTabWidth()`.)

- Word wrapping is turned on. (See {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetWordWrap()`.)

- Automatic indenting is turned off. (See
  {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetAutoindent()`.)

- The maximum amount of data is permitted. (See
  {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetMaxBytes()`.)

- The view doesn't grow to accommodate more characters. (See
  {cpp:func}`~BTextView::MakeResizable()`.)

- All characters the user may type are acceptable. (See
  {cpp:func}`~BTextView::DisallowChar()`.)

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual BTextView::~BTextView()()
:::

Frees the memory the {hclass}`BTextView` allocated to hold the text and to
store information about it.
::::

## Hook Functions

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::AttachedToWindow()
:::

Completes the initialization of the {hclass}`BTextView` object after it
becomes attached to a window. This function sets up the object so that it
can correctly format text and display it. Among other things, it sets the
drawing mode to {cpp:enumerator}`B_OP_COPY`. If the {hclass}`BTextView` is
targeted by scroll bars, it adjusts them so that they're accurately set up
for scrolling the text.

Because the {hclass}`BTextView` uses pulses to animate (or "blink") the
caret, the vertical line that marks the current insertion point, this
function also enables pulsing in the window and fixes the pulse rate at 2
per second.

{hmethod}`AttachedToWindow()` is called for you when the
{hclass}`BTextView` becomes part a window's view hierarchy; you shouldn't
call it yourself, though you can override it. A function that's implemented
by a derived class should begin by incorporating the {hclass}`BTextView`
version:

:::{code} cpp
void MyText::AttachedToWindow()
{
   BTextView::AttachedToWindow()
   . . .
}
:::

If it doesn't, the {hclass}`BTextView` won't be able to properly display
the text.

See also: {cpp:func}`BView::AttachedToWindow()`
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::DetachedFromWindow()
:::

Resets the cursor to the standard hand image
({cpp:enumerator}`B_HAND_CURSOR`) if it's above the {hclass}`BTextView`
when the {hclass}`BTextView` is removed from the window.

See also: {cpp:func}`BView::DetachedFromWindow()`
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::Draw(BRect updateRect)
:::

Draws the {hclass}`BTextView`.

See also: {cpp:func}`BView::Draw()`
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::FrameResized(float width, float height)
:::

Overrides the {cpp:class}`BView` {cpp:func}`version <BView::FrameResized>`
of this function to reset the ranges of the {hclass}`BTextView`'s scroll
bars and to update the sizes of their proportional knobs whenever the size
of the {hclass}`BTextView` changes.

See also: {cpp:func}`BView::FrameResized()`
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::KeyDown(const char* bytes, int32 numBytes)
:::

Enters text at the current selection in response to the user's typing. This
function is called from the window's message loop for every report of a
key-down event—typically once for every character the user types. However,
it does nothing unless the {hclass}`BTextView` is the focus view and the
text it contains is editable.

If the character encoded in the bytes string is an editing instruction,
{hmethod}`KeyDown()` takes the appropriate action:

- If the character is from one of the arrow keys
  ({cpp:enumerator}`B_UP_ARROW`, {cpp:enumerator}`B_LEFT_ARROW`,
  {cpp:enumerator}`B_DOWN_ARROW`, or {cpp:enumerator}`B_RIGHT_ARROW`), it
  extends the selection or moves the insertion point in the appropriate
  direction, depending on the modifiers

- If the character is {cpp:enumerator}`B_BACKSPACE` or
  {cpp:enumerator}`B_DELETE`, it deletes the current selection—or the
  character preceding or following the current insertion point.

- If the character comes from one of the paging keys
  ({cpp:enumerator}`B_HOME`, {cpp:enumerator}`B_END`,
  {cpp:enumerator}`B_PAGE_UP`, or {cpp:enumerator}`B_PAGE_DOWN`), it
  scrolls the display.

Otherwise, it checks whether the character was registered as unacceptable
(by {cpp:func}`~BTextView::DisallowChar()`). If not disallowed, it calls
the {cpp:func}`~BTextView::InsertText()` hook function to enter the
character into the text and display it. Derived classes can preview
about-to-be-inserted characters by overriding
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::InsertText()`.

See also: {cpp:func}`BView::KeyDown()`
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::MessageReceived(BMessage* message)
:::

Augments the {cpp:class}`BView` version of
{cpp:func}`~BView::MessageReceived()` to handle scripting requests, dropped
data, and four editing messages—{cpp:enumerator}`B_CUT`,
{cpp:enumerator}`B_COPY`, {cpp:enumerator}`B_PASTE`, and
{cpp:enumerator}`B_SELECT_ALL`.

If the message was dragged and dropped on the {hclass}`BTextView` and it
contains {cpp:enumerator}`B_MIME_TYPE` data under the name "text/plain",
this function inserts the new text at the point where it was dropped—but
only if {cpp:func}`~BTextView::AcceptsDrop()` returns {cpp:expr}`true` for
the message.

This function handles {cpp:enumerator}`B_CUT`, {cpp:enumerator}`B_COPY`,
{cpp:enumerator}`B_PASTE`, and {cpp:enumerator}`B_SELECT_ALL` messages by
calling the {cpp:func}`~BTextView::Cut()`, {cpp:func}`~BTextView::Copy()`,
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::Paste()`, and {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SelectAll()`
functions. A {hclass}`BTextView` will get these messages, even if the
application doesn't send them, when it's the focus view and the user uses
the {hkey}`Command`+{hkey}`x`, {hkey}`Command`+{hkey}`c`,
{hkey}`Command`+{hkey}`v`, and {hkey}`Command`+{hkey}`a` shortcuts. See
"{ref}`Shortcuts and Menu Items`" in the class overview for information on
how to set up compatible Cut, Copy, Paste, and Select All menu items.

To inherit this functionality, {hmethod}`MessageReceived()` functions
implemented by derived classes should be sure to call the
{hclass}`BTextView` version.

{cpp:func}`~BTextView::InsertText()`, {cpp:func}`BView::MessageReceived()`,
{cpp:func}`BInvoker::SetMessage()`, {cpp:func}`BInvoker::SetTarget()`
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::MouseDown(BPoint point)
:::

Selects text, drags text, and positions the insertion point in response to
the user's mouse actions. If the {hclass}`BTextView` isn't already the
focus view for its window, this function calls
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::MakeFocus()` to make it the focus view.

{hmethod}`MouseDown()` is called for each mouse-down event that occurs
inside the {hclass}`BTextView`'s frame rectangle.

See also: {cpp:func}`BView::MouseDown()`
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::MouseMoved(BPoint point, uint32 transit, BMessage* message)
:::

Responds to {cpp:enumerator}`B_MOUSE_MOVED` messages by changing the cursor
to the standard I-beam image for editing text whenever the cursor enters
the view and by resetting it to the standard hand image when the cursor
exits the view. The cursor is changed to an I-beam for text that is
selectable or editable, but only if the {hclass}`BTextView` is the current
focus view in the active window. However, when the cursor moves over the
current selection, this function changes it from the I-beam back to the
standard hand image. This is done to indicate that it's possible to drag
and drop the current selection.

If a message is being dragged to the {hclass}`BTextView`, this function
tests it see whether it contains textual data and tracks it to its
destination.

{cpp:func}`~BTextView::AcceptsDrop()`
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::Pulse()
:::

Turns the caret marking the current insertion point on and off when the
{hclass}`BTextView` is the focus view in the active window.
{hmethod}`Pulse()` is called by the system at regular intervals.

This function is first declared in the {cpp:class}`BView` class.

See also: {cpp:func}`BView::Pulse()`
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::WindowActivated(bool flag)
:::

Highlights the current selection when the {hclass}`BTextView`'s window
becomes the active window (when {hparam}`flag` is
{cpp:expr}`true`)—provided that the {hclass}`BTextView` is the current
focus view—and removes the highlighting when the window ceases to be the
active window (when {hparam}`flag` is {cpp:expr}`false`).

If the current selection is empty (if it's an insertion point), it's
highlighted by turning the caret on and off (blinking it).

The Interface Kit calls this function for you whenever the
{hclass}`BTextView`'s window becomes the active window or it loses that
status.

{cpp:func}`~BTextView::MakeFocus()`

## Member Functions

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual bool BTextView::AcceptsDrop(const BMessage* archive)
:::

:::{cpp:function} virtual bool BTextView::AcceptsPaste(BClipboard* clipboard)
:::

These functions look at the data in their arguments, and return
{cpp:expr}`true` if its "acceptable." The default implementations return
{cpp:expr}`true` if both of the following are {cpp:expr}`true`:

- the {hclass}`BTextView` is editable

- the message or clipboard contains {cpp:enumerator}`B_MIME_TYPE` data
  stored under the name "text/plain".

If the data isn't acceptable, the drop or paste operation is aborted.

{hmethod}`AcceptsDrop()` is invoked in two places: When a message is
dragged over the {hclass}`BTextView`, and when the message is dropped on
the object. {hmethod}`AcceptsPaste()` is called when a
{cpp:enumerator}`B_PASTE` message is received. If you augment these
functions to accept more types, you'll also have to augment the
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::MessageReceived()` and
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::Paste()` functions to insert the text found in
message or clipboard.
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual status_t BTextView::Archive(BMessage* archive, bool deep = true) const
:::

Calls the inherited version of {cpp:func}`~BView::Archive()` and stores the
{hclass}`BTextView` in the {cpp:class}`BMessage` archive.

See also: {cpp:func}`BArchivable::Archive()`,
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::Instantiate()` static function
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual bool BTextView::CanEndLine(int32 offset)
:::

Returns {cpp:expr}`true` if the character at offset can be the last
character in a line of text, and {cpp:expr}`false` if not. Sometimes this
depends on whether the next character (if there is one) can begin a line.
This function is called as the {hclass}`BTextView` figures out where to
break lines, but only if word wrapping is turned on.

As implemented, {hmethod}`CanEndLine()` allows the following ASCII
characters to end a line regardless of the context:

:::{code} sh
B_SPACE =  < / &
B_TAB   +  > *
B_ENTER -- ^ | '\0'
:::

The default implementation also understands the line-ending conventions for
Chinese and Japanese. Because these languages are written without the
spaces that typically end lines in other languages, lines can potentially
break anywhere. However, certain characters are prohibited from ending a
line and others are prohibited from beginning a new line.
{hmethod}`CanEndLine()` prevents lines from ending either on a prohibited
ending character or on the character before a prohibited beginning
character.

Derived classes can override this function to apply different criteria for
where lines end, possibly looking at the context of the offset character.
You can also augment the current implementation so that it understands the
conventions for other languages.

If you override this function to look to the left or right of the character
at offset, be sure to check that you haven't stepped beyond the range of
the text. For example, this version of the function makes sure that the
first hyphen of a pair doesn't break a line:

:::{code} cpp
bool MyTextView::CanEndLine(int32 offset)
{
   if ( ByteAt[offset] == '-' ) {
      if ( TextLength() - offset > 1 ) {
            if ( ByteAt[offset + 1] == '-' )
               return false;
      }
   }
   return (baseClass::CanEndLine(offset));
}

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::Cut(BClipboard* clipboard)
:::

:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::Copy(BClipboard* clipboard)
:::

:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::Paste(BClipboard* clipboard)
:::

:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::Clear()
:::

These functions implement the standard cut, copy, paste, and clear
commands. {hmethod}`Cut()` and {hmethod}`Copy()` both copy the current
selection to the specified clipboard; {hmethod}`Cut()` also deletes the
text from the {hclass}`BTextView` and removes it from the display. The text
is entered in the clipboard as {cpp:enumerator}`B_MIME_TYPE` data under the
name "text/plain". {hmethod}`Paste()` looks in the clipboard for just this
type of data and pastes it into the text—but only if
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::AcceptsPaste()` returns {cpp:expr}`true`. The new
text replaces the current selection, or is placed at the site of the
current insertion point.

If the {hclass}`BTextView` supports multiple character formats,
{hmethod}`Cut()` and {hmethod}`Copy()` also place a {htype}`text_run_array`
structure describing the formats of the copied text in the clipboard—as
{cpp:enumerator}`B_MIME_TYPE` data under the name
"application/x-vnd.Be-text_run_array". If the {hclass}`BTextView` that
takes text from the clipboard supports multiple formats, {hmethod}`Paste()`
looks for the {htype}`text_run_array` in the clipboard and sets the formats
of the pasted text accordingly.

In most cases, the clipboard argument will be identical to the global
{hparam}`be_clipboard` object.

The {hmethod}`Clear()` function simply removes the currently-selected text
from the {hclass}`BTextView` without affecting any clipboard. If there's no
selection, nothing happens.

See also: {cpp:func}`~BTextView::AcceptsPaste()`, "{ref}`Shortcuts and Menu
Items`" in the overview
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::DisallowChar(uint32 aChar)
:::

:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::AllowChar(uint32 aChar)
:::

These functions inform the {hclass}`BTextView` whether the user should be
allowed to enter {hparam}`aChar` into the text. By default, all characters
are allowed. Call {hmethod}`DisallowChar()` for each character you want to
prevent the {hclass}`BTextView` from accepting, preferably when first
setting up the object. Although declared as {htype}`uint32`,
{hparam}`aChar` must be a character encoded in a single byte; it can't be a
16-bit Unicode value or a multibyte UTF-8 string.

{hmethod}`AllowChar()` reverses the effect of {hmethod}`DisallowChar()`.

Alternatively, and for more control over the context in which characters
are accepted or rejected, you can implement an
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::InsertText()` function for the {hclass}`BTextView`.
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::InsertText()` is called for all insertions,
including each character the user types, all text the user drags to the
{hclass}`BTextView`, and all attempts to paste from the clipboard.
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::FindWord(int32 offset, int32* start, int32* finish)
:::

Looks for a sequence of characters that qualifies as a word—that is, a
sequence that the user can double-click to select—that includes the
character at {hparam}`offset`. This function places the offset of the
word's first character in the variable that {hparam}`start` refers to and
the offset following the last character in the word in the variable that
{hparam}`finish` refers to. If the {hparam}`offset` character can't be part
of a word, the {hparam}`start` and {hparam}`finish` offsets will be
identical.

As implemented, this function allows the user to select a group of similar
characters with a double-click. For example, in the following line of
malformed text,

:::{code} sh
"You what!!?"
:::

it would allow the user to select the words "You" and "what," the group of
spaces between the words, and the group of punctuation marks at the end.

The function also defines similar groups of Japanese characters that can be
selected together.
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::GetDragParameters(BMessage* drag, BBitmap** bitmap, BPoint* point, BHandler** handler)
:::

{hmethod}`GetDragParameters()` is called when a drag session is initiated.
The values that it retrieves (by reference in the arguments) are passed on
to {cpp:func}`BView::DragMessage()`. If you don't supply a bitmap (if you
set {hparam}`*bitmap` to {cpp:expr}`NULL`), the outline rectangle version
of {cpp:func}`~BView::DragMessage()` is used.
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::GetSelection(int32* start, int32* finish)
:::

Provides the current selection by writing the offset before the first
selected character into the variable referred to by {hparam}`start` and the
offset after the last selected character into the variable referred to by
{hparam}`finish`. If no characters are selected, both offsets will record
the position of the current insertion point.

If the text isn't selectable, both offsets will be 0.

See also: {cpp:func}`~BTextView::Select()`
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::GetTextRegion(int32 start, int32 finish, BRegion* region) const
:::

Calculates the region where the run of characters beginning at the
{hparam}`start` offset and ending at the {hparam}`finish` offset would be
displayed within the {hclass}`BTextView`'s coordinate system, and modifies
the {cpp:class}`BRegion` object passed as the third argument,
{hparam}`region`, so that it represents that region.

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::GoToLine(int32 index)
:::

:::{cpp:function} int32 BTextView::CurrentLine() const
:::

:::{cpp:function} int32 BTextView::CountLines() const
:::

{hmethod}`GoToLine()` moves the insertion point to the beginning of the
line at {hparam}`index`. The first line has an index of 0, the second line
an index of 1, and so on. If the index is out-of-range, the insertion point
is moved to the beginning of the line with the nearest in-range index—that
is, to either the first or the last line.

{hmethod}`CurrentLine()` returns the index of the line where the first
character of the selection—or the character following the insertion
point—is currently located.

{hmethod}`CountLines()` returns how many lines of text the
{hclass}`BTextView` currently contains.

Like other functions that change the selection, {hmethod}`GoToLine()`
doesn't automatically scroll the display to make the new selection visible.
Call {cpp:func}`~BTextView::ScrollToSelection()` to be sure that the user
can see the start of the selection.
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::HideTyping(bool flag)
:::

:::{cpp:function} bool BTextView::IsTypingHidden() const
:::

The first of these functions sets whether the user can see the text in the
{hclass}`BTextView`; the second returns whether or not the text is
currently visible. When flag's state is {cpp:expr}`true`, text contained by
the {hclass}`BTextView` isn't visible.
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} inline void BTextView::Highlight(int32 start, int32 finish)
:::

Highlights (or unhighlights) the characters between the {hparam}`start` and
{hparam}`finish` offsets. This is the function that the {hclass}`BTextView`
calls to highlight and unhighlight the current selection. You don't need to
call it yourself for this purpose. It's in the public API just in case you
may need to highlight a range of text in some other circumstance.

If the text is not currently highlighted, this function highlights it. But
if the text is already highlighted, it unhighlights it. If you highlight
some text, be sure to unhighlight it before the next editorial change; the
{hclass}`BTextView` will not do it for you.

:::

:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::Delete()
:::

:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::Delete(int32 start, int32 finish)
:::

{hmethod}`Insert()` adds {hparam}`length` bytes of text to the
{hclass}`BTextView`—or if a length isn't specified, all the characters of
the text string up to the null character that terminates it. The text is
inserted at {hparam}`offset`—or at the beginning of the current selection
if an {hparam}`offset` isn't specified. The current selection is not
deleted and the insertion is not selected.

The inserted characters are displayed in the fonts and colors specified in
the accompanying {hparam}`runs` array, provided the {hclass}`BTextView`
allows multiple character formats. If multiple formats aren't allowed, the
{hparam}`runs` array is ignored. If multiple formats are allowed but a
{hparam}`runs` array isn't provided, the insertion is displayed in the font
and color in force at the point of insertion. This generally means the font
and color of the first character of the selection, or of the character
immediately preceding the offset character.

Offsets in the {hparam}`runs` array should describe the text being
inserted; in other words, the first offset should be 0. See
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetRunArray()` for a description of the
{htype}`text_run_array` structure.

{hmethod}`Insert()` doesn't assume responsibility for the {hparam}`text`
data or the {hparam}`runs` array. It copies the information it needs.

{hmethod}`Delete()` removes the characters bounded by the {hparam}`start`
and {hparam}`finish` offsets from the display and deletes them from the
{hclass}`BTextView`'s text, without copying them to the clipboard. If the
{hparam}`start` and {hparam}`finish` offsets are the same, nothing is
deleted. If offsets are not provided, {hmethod}`Delete()` deletes the
current selection.

:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::DeleteText(int32 start, int32 finish)
:::

These protected functions are the vehicles through which the
{hclass}`BTextView` performs every insertion and deletion of text (with one
exception). You can augment them in a subclass to take note of pending
changes to the text, and to modify or prevent the change.

Don't call {hmethod}`Insert()`, {hmethod}`Delete()` or any other high-level
text-manipulating function in your implementation.

{hmethod}`InsertText()` adds {hparam}`length` bytes of text to the
{hclass}`BTextView`, inserting it at {hparam}`offset` within the text
buffer. The font and color of the inserted characters may be described by
an accompanying {hparam}`runs` array. If the {hclass}`BTextView` doesn't
support multiple character formats, the {hparam}`runs` array is ignored. If
multiple formats are supported but the {hparam}`runs` array is
{cpp:expr}`NULL`, the text is displayed in the font and color of the
character preceding offset (or of the first character, if offset is 0.)

The offsets in the {hparam}`runs` data structure are relative to the
inserted text; that is, the first offset in the array is 0, not
{hparam}`offset`.

{hmethod}`InsertText()` is called for every insertion, except one. The
exception occurs when {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetText()` takes text from a
file; in this case the text goes directly from the file to the
{hclass}`BTextView`; it's not stored in a temporary buffer while
{hmethod}`InsertText()` is called.

{hmethod}`DeleteText()` removes the text bounded by the {hparam}`start` and
{hparam}`finish` offsets. It fails if the offsets don't differ, or if the
{hparam}`finish` offset isn't greater than the {hparam}`start` offset. This
function is called for every deletion.

These functions translate between coordinate values, text offsets, and line
indices. {hmethod}`LineAt()` returns the index of the line containing the
character at {hparam}`offset` in the text, or the line located at the
specified {hparam}`point` in the {hclass}`BTextView`'s coordinate system.
Line indices begin at 0.

{hmethod}`PointAt()` returns the coordinate location of the character at
{hparam}`offset`. The point is the left top corner of a rectangle enclosing
the character and is stated in the {hclass}`BTextView`'s coordinate system.
The x-coordinate of the point is the position on the baseline where the
character is (or would be) drawn; its y-coordinate is the top of the line
where the {hparam}`offset` character is located. If a {hparam}`height`
argument is provided, {hmethod}`PointAt()` returns the height of the line
by reference.

{hmethod}`OffsetAt()` returns the offset to the character that begins the
{hparam}`index` line, or to the character displayed at {hparam}`point`.

:::

{hmethod}`LineHeight()` returns the height of the line of text at
{hparam}`index`, or the first line if an index isn't specified. Line
indices begin at 0. The height is stated in coordinate units and depends on
the font. It's the sum of how far characters can ascend above and descend
below the baseline, plus the amount of leading that separates lines. If
more than one font is used on the line, the ascent is taken from the
tallest font and the descent and leading from the deepest.

{hmethod}`TextHeight()` returns the height of the set of lines from
{hparam}`firstIndex` through {hparam}`lastIndex`.

Both functions reset out-of-range indices to be in-range—that is, to the
index of the first or last line.

(in coordinate units) of all the characters in the line, from the first
through the last, including tabs and spaces. Line indices begin at 0.

If the {hparam}`index` passed is out-of-range, it's reinterpreted to be the
nearest in-range index—that is, as the index to the first or the last line.

focus view (when {hparam}`flag` is {cpp:expr}`true`) and to unhighlight it
when the {hclass}`BTextView` no longer is the focus view (when
{hparam}`flag` is {cpp:expr}`false`). However, the current selection is
highlighted only if the {hclass}`BTextView`'s window is the current active

:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::MakeResizable(bool resizable, BView* containerView = NULL)
:::

:::{cpp:function} bool BTextView::IsResizable() const
:::

{hmethod}`MakeResizable()` gives the {hclass}`BTextView` the ability to
automatically resize itself to fit its contents if the {hparam}`resizable`
flag is {cpp:expr}`true`, and takes away that ability if the flag is
{cpp:expr}`false`. {hmethod}`IsResizable()` returns whether the
{hclass}`BTextView` is currently resizable.

The frame rectangle and text rectangle of a resizable {hclass}`BTextView`
automatically grow and shrink to exactly enclose all the characters entered
by the user. The object should display just a single line of text (the
resizing is horizontal); if the {hparam}`resizable` flag is
{cpp:expr}`true`, {hmethod}`MakeResizable()` turns off line wrapping. The
text can be aligned to the left, right, or center of the text rectangle.

The {hparam}`containerView` is a view that draws a border around the text
(like a {cpp:class}`BScrollView` object) and is the parent of the
{hclass}`BTextView`; it's the view that's resized to fit the text. The
{hclass}`BTextView`'s resizing mode should be such that it will be resized
in tandem with the container (for example,
{cpp:enumerator}`B_FOLLOW_LEFT_RIGHT` or
{cpp:enumerator}`B_FOLLOW_ALL_SIDES`). However, if the
{hparam}`containerView` is {cpp:expr}`NULL`, as it is by default, the
{hclass}`BTextView` itself is resized to fit the text.

If the {hparam}`resizable` flag is {cpp:expr}`false`, the
{hparam}`containerView` argument is ignored.

This resizing mechanism is an alternative to the automatic resizing
behavior provided in the {cpp:class}`BView` class. It triggers resizing on
the user's entry of text, not on a change in the parent view's size. The
two schemes are incompatible; the container view (or the
{hclass}`BTextView`, if there is no container) should not automatically
resize itself when its parent is resized.

characters to copy to the clipboard, but can't position the insertion point
(an empty selection), enter characters from the keyboard, or paste new text

:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::ScrollToSelection()
:::

These functions scroll the text so that the character at
{hparam}`offset`—or the character that begins the current selection—is
within the visible region of the view. If the {hclass}`BTextView` is
equipped with scroll bars, the {cpp:class}`BScrollBar` objects are informed

Selects the characters from {hparam}`start` up to {hparam}`finish`, where
{hparam}`start` and {hparam}`finish` are offsets into the
{hclass}`BTextView`'s text. If {hparam}`start` and {hparam}`finish` are the
same, the selection will be empty (an insertion point). See
"{ref}`Offsets`" in the class overview for a discussion of the constraints
on the offset arguments.

Normally, the selection is changed by the user. This function provides a
way to change it programmatically.

If the {hclass}`BTextView` is the current focus view in the active window,
{hmethod}`Select()` highlights the new selection (or displays a blinking
caret at the insertion point). However, it doesn't automatically scroll the
contents of the {hclass}`BTextView` to make the new selection visible. Call
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::ScrollToSelection()` to be sure that the user can

:::{cpp:function} virtual void BTextView::Undo(BClipboard* clipboard)
:::

:::{code} c
enum undo_state {}
:::

These functions and enum comprise {hclass}`BTextView`'s undo world. The
operations that {hclass}`BTextView` can undo are listed below. The default
undo mechanism is one operation deep: Udoing undoes the previous
(undo-able) operation; a second (immediate) undo redoes the operation.

You call {hmethod}`SetDoesUndo()` to enable or disable the undo machinery
for this object. By default, undo is enabled. The ability to undo is also
controlled by the object's editability (
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::MakeEditable()`), but this is a tautology, since in
order to have something to undo you have to have been able to edit the
object in the first place.

{hmethod}`DoesUndo()` tells you whether the object is "undoable" as set by
{hmethod}`SetDoesUndo()`. It doesn't take editability into consideration.

{hmethod}`UndoState()` tells you what the previous action was (as
represented by the constants listed below). This is the action that will be
undone if the object is told to undo. The {hparam}`isRedo` value that's
returned by reference is set to {cpp:expr}`true` if the previous action
occurred because of an undo.

:::

The {hmethod}`Undo()` hook function is called when the {hclass}`BTextView`
receives a {cpp:enumerator}`B_UNDO` message. (By default,
{cpp:enumerator}`B_UNDO` is bound to the window's {hkey}`Command`+{hkey}`z`
shortcut; Undo menu items need to set up the binding explicitly.) The
{hparam}`clipboard` argument is a pointer to the {hparam}`be_clipboard`; if
you're using a custom clipboard in your {hclass}`BTextView` subclass, you
should pass along your clipboard when you invoke the inherited version of
{hmethod}`Undo()`.

Don't try to do too much in a subclass implementation of {hmethod}`Undo()`.
In particular, you probably won't get too far if you're trying to "broaden"
the undo tree.

:::

:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::GetFontAndColor(BFont* font, uint32* sameProperties = B_FONT_ALL, rgb_color* color = NULL, bool* sameColor = NULL) const
:::

These functions set and get the font and color used to display the text. If
the {hclass}`BTextView` supports multiple character formats,
{hmethod}`SetFontAndColor()` sets the font and color of the characters
bounded by the {hparam}`start` and {hparam}`finish` offsets. If no offsets
are given, it sets the font and color of the current selection. However, if
multiple character formats are not supported, {hmethod}`SetFontAndColor()`
ignores the offsets and formats the entire text.

{hmethod}`SetFontAndColor()` works like {cpp:class}`BView`'s
{cpp:func}`~BView::SetFont()` function. It sets the {hparam}`font` to the
attributes of the font {cpp:class}`BFont` object that are enumerated by the
properties mask. The mask is formed by combining the following constants:

- {cpp:enumerator}`B_FONT_FAMILY_AND_STYLE`

- {cpp:enumerator}`B_FONT_SIZE`

- {cpp:enumerator}`B_FONT_SHEAR`

- {cpp:enumerator}`B_FONT_ROTATION`

- {cpp:enumerator}`B_FONT_SPACING`

- {cpp:enumerator}`B_FONT_ENCODING`

- {cpp:enumerator}`B_FONT_FACE`

- {cpp:enumerator}`B_FONT_FLAGS`

In addition, {cpp:enumerator}`B_FONT_ALL` is a shorthand for all properties
of the specified font. However, the {hclass}`BTextView` modifies the font
to ensure that:

- Characters are not rotated.

- Antialiasing is not disabled.

- The spacing mode is {cpp:enumerator}`B_BITMAP_SPACING`.

- The character encoding is UTF-8 ({cpp:enumerator}`B_UNICODE_UTF8`).

If the {hparam}`font` argument is {cpp:expr}`NULL`, the font is not set and
the properties mask is ignored.

The color of the characters is set by a pointer to an {htype}`rgb_color`
structure. If the pointer is {cpp:expr}`NULL`, as it is by default, the
color is not set.

{hmethod}`GetFontAndColor()` gets the font and color used to display the
character at {hparam}`offset`. It modifies the {hparam}`font`
{cpp:class}`BFont` object and the {hparam}`color` {htype}`rgb_color`
structure so that they describe the font and color of the character.

If an {hparam}`offset` isn't specified, {hmethod}`GetFontAndColor()` looks
at the current selection. It provides a font and color description of the
first character of the selection—or the character at the insertion point if
the selection is empty. It also modifies that variable that the
{hparam}`sameProperties` argument refers to so that it lists all the font
properties that are uniform for all characters in the selection. Similarly,
it indicates, in the variable that {hparam}`sameColor` refers to, whether
all the characters in the selection are displayed in the same color.

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} void BTextView::SetMaxBytes(int32 max)
:::

:::{cpp:function} int32 BTextView::MaxBytes() const
:::

These functions set and return the maximum number of bytes that the
{hclass}`BTextView` can accept. The default is the maximum number of bytes
that can be designated by a signed 32-bit integer, a number sufficiently
large to accommodate all uses of a {hclass}`BTextView`. Use this function
only if you need to restrict the number of characters that the user can
enter in a text field.

Note that these functions count bytes, not characters.

:::

:::{cpp:function} text_run_array* BTextView::RunArray(int32 start, int32 finish, int32* length = NULL) const
:::

These functions set and return the font and color formats of all the
characters bounded by the {hparam}`start` and {hparam}`finish` offsets. The
formats are described by a {htype}`text_run_array` structure, which has the
following fields:

:::{list-table}
---
header-rows: 1
align: left
widths: auto
---
-
	- Field

	- Description

-
	- int32count
	- The number of {htype}`text_run` structures in the array.
-
	- text_runruns[1]
	- A structure describing the font and color formats in effect at a particular
		offset in the {hclass}`BTextView`'s text.

:::

The {htype}`text_run` structure describes a run of characters that share
the same font and color formats. It has three fields:

:::{list-table}
---
header-rows: 1
align: left
widths: auto
---
-
	- Field

	- Description

-
	- int32offset
	- An offset to the first byte of a character in the text buffer. The text run
		begins with this character; it continues until another run begins.
-
	- BFontfont
	- The font that's used to display the run of characters beginning at the
		specified offset.
-
	- rgb_colorcolor
	- The color that's used to display the run of characters beginning at the
		specified offset.

:::

The first offset of the first {htype}`text_run` in the array passed to
{hmethod}`SetRunArray()` should be 0; the array returned by
{hmethod}`RunArray()` also begins at offset 0.

If the {hclass}`BTextView` doesn't support multiple character formats,
{hmethod}`SetRunArray()` ignores the {hparam}`start` and {hparam}`finish`
offsets and sets the entire text to the font and color of the first
{htype}`text_run` in the array. Similarly, {hmethod}`RunArray()` returns a
{htype}`text_run_array` with one {htype}`text_run` describing the entire
text.

{hmethod}`RunArray()` returns a pointer to memory that it allocated (using
malloc()). It puts the number of bytes that it allocated in the variable
that the {hparam}`length` argument points to. Although
{hmethod}`RunArray()` allocated the memory, the caller is responsible for
freeing it when the returned {htype}`text_run_array` is no longer needed.

{hmethod}`SetRunArray()` doesn't assume responsibility for the runs data
it's passed; it's up to the caller to free it.

multiple character formats. If the {hparam}`stylable` flag is
{cpp:expr}`true`, the functions that set the font and color of the text can
apply to particular characters in the text buffer. If the flag is
{cpp:expr}`false`, those functions apply only to the entire text. When
{hmethod}`SetStylable()` is called to turn off support for multiple
formats, all the text is reformatted in the font and color of the first
character.

{hmethod}`IsStylable()` returns whether multiple formats are permitted. By
default, they're not.

:::

Removes any text currently in the {hclass}`BTextView` and copies new text
from a {hparam}`text` buffer or from a {hparam}`file` to replace it. This
function copies {hparam}`length` bytes of text from the buffer—or all the
bytes in the buffer, up to the null character, if a {hparam}`length` isn't
specified. Or it copies {hparam}`length` bytes from the {hparam}`file`
beginning at the {hparam}`offset` byte. If the {hparam}`text` or
{hparam}`file` is {cpp:expr}`NULL` or {hparam}`length` is 0, it empties the
{hclass}`BTextView` without replacing the text.

If a {hparam}`runs` {htype}`text_run_array` is provided, it will be used to
set the font and color formats of the new text—provided that the
{hclass}`BTextView` permits multiple character formats. If not, the
{hparam}`runs` array is ignored.

The {hclass}`BTextView` doesn't assume ownership of the {hparam}`text`
buffer, the {hparam}`file`, or the {hparam}`runs` array; you can delete
them when {hmethod}`SetText()` returns.

Text taken from a file is inserted directly into the text, bypassing the
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::InsertText()` function. In other words, you won't
receive an {cpp:func}`~BTextView::InsertText()` notification for text taken
from a file.

This function is typically used to set the text initially displayed in the
view. If the {hclass}`BTextView` is already attached to a window, it's
updated to show its new contents.

These functions set and return whether the {hclass}`BTextView` wraps lines
on word boundaries, thus pushing entire words that don't fit at the end of
a line to the next line. When word wrapping is turned on, the
{hclass}`BTextView` calls {cpp:func}`~BTextView::CanEndLine()` to determine
exactly where a line can break. If word wrapping is off, lines break only
on a newline character (where the user types {hkey}`Return`).

By default, word wrapping is turned on ({hmethod}`DoesWordWrap()` returns
{cpp:expr}`true`).

:::{cpp:function} uchar BTextView::ByteAt(int32 offset) const
:::

These functions reveal the text contained in the {hclass}`BTextView`.

{hmethod}`Text()` returns a pointer to the text, which may be a pointer to
an empty string if the {hclass}`BTextView` is empty. The returned pointer
can be used to read the text, but not to alter it (use
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetText()`, {cpp:func}`~BTextView::Insert()`,
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::Delete()`, and other {hclass}`BTextView` functions
to do that).

{hmethod}`GetText()` copies up to {hparam}`length` bytes of the text into
{hparam}`buffer`, beginning with the byte at {hparam}`offset`, and adds a
null terminator ('0'). Fewer than {hparam}`length` bytes are copied if
there aren't that many between the specified {hparam}`offset` and the end
of the text. This function doesn't make any attempt to ensure that only
full character specifications are copied; it's up to the caller to make
sure that a character begins at {hparam}`offset` and that the last byte
copied isn't in the middle of a multibyte character. The results won't be
reliable if the {hparam}`offset` is out-of-range.

{hmethod}`ByteAt()` returns the byte located at {hparam}`offset`. The
offset doesn't have to be to the first byte of a character.

The pointer that {hmethod}`Text()` returns is to the {hclass}`BTextView`'s
internal representation of the text. When it returns, the text string is
guaranteed to be null-terminated and without gaps. However, the
{hclass}`BTextView` may have had to manipulate the text to get it in that
condition. Therefore, there may be a performance price to pay if
{hmethod}`Text()` is called frequently. If you're going to copy the text,
it's more efficient to have {hmethod}`GetText()` do it for you. If you're
going to index into the text, it may be more efficient to call
{hmethod}`ByteAt()`.

The pointer that {hmethod}`Text()` returns may no longer be valid after the
user or the program next changes the text. Even if valid, the string may no
longer be null-terminated and gaps may appear.

Returns the number of bytes of text data the {hclass}`BTextView` currently
contains—the number of bytes in the string that
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::Text()` returns (not counting the null terminator).

## Static Functions

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} static void* BTextView::FlattenRunArray(const text_run_array* runs = NULL, int32* numBytes = NULL)
:::

:::{cpp:function} static text_run_array* BTextView::UnflattenRunArray(const void* data, int32* numBytes = NULL)
:::

These functions flatten and unflatten a {htype}`text_run_array` structure
so that it can be treated as an untyped stream of bytes. A
{htype}`text_run_array` that's saved on-disk will be valid when the user
reboots the machine only if it's saved as flat data. Both functions return
pointers to memory they allocate (with malloc()). The caller is responsible
for freeing the memory when it's no longer needed.

{hmethod}`FlattenRunArray()` flattens the runs {htype}`text_run_array` and
returns the flat data. {hmethod}`UnflattenRunArray()` reconstructs a
{htype}`text_run_array` from previously flattened data and returns a
pointer to the structure.

If a {hparam}`numBytes` argument is provided, both functions place the
number of bytes they allocated for the data in the variable that
{hparam}`numBytes` refers to.

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} static BArchivable* BTextView::Instantiate(BMessage* archive)
:::

Returns a new {hclass}`BTextView` object, allocated by new and created by
the version of the constructor that takes a {cpp:class}`BMessage` archive.
However, if the archive doesn't contain data for a {hclass}`BTextView`
object, the return value will be {cpp:expr}`NULL`.

{cpp:func}`~BTextView::Archive()`

## Scripting Support

The {hclass}`BTextView` class implements an unnamed suite consisting of the
following messages:

### The Selection Property

The current text selection

Using two {htype}`int32` offsets to the beginning and end of the selection
in either the "result" or "data" arrays, these messages convey the current
selection of the object in a manner identical to
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::GetSelection()` and
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::Select()`.

:::{list-table}
---
header-rows: 1
align: left
widths: auto
---
-
	- Message

	- Specifiers

	- Description

-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_GET_PROPERTY`

	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_DIRECT_SPECIFIER`

	- Returns the current selection.

-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_SET_PROPERTY`

	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_DIRECT_SPECIFIER`

	- Sets the current selection.


:::

### The Text Property

The text in the view

The "Text" get and set messages correspond to the method
{cpp:func}`~BTextView::GetText()` and {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetText()`,
using a C string to store the data. If the {cpp:enumerator}`B_SET_PROPERTY`
message lacks a "data" member, the selection is deleted; otherwise, "range"
bytes are inserted at offset "index." The values specifying the range are
given in byte rather than character offsets. The range counts towards the
end of the text, even for {cpp:enumerator}`B_REVERSE_RANGE_SPECIFIER`.

	- Description

-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_COUNT_PROPERTY`

	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_DIRECT_SPECIFIER`

	- Returns the length of the text in bytes.

-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_GET_PROPERTY`

	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_RANGE_SPECIFIER`,
{cpp:enumerator}`B_REVERSE_RANGE_SPECIFIER`

	- Returns the text in the specified range in the {hclass}`BTextView`.

-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_SET_PROPERTY`

	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_RANGE_SPECIFIER`,
{cpp:enumerator}`B_REVERSE_RANGE_SPECIFIER`

	- Removes or inserts text into the specified range in the
{hclass}`BTextView`.


:::

### The text_run_array Property

Font and color information for the text

These messages correspond to the methods {cpp:func}`~BTextView::RunArray()`
and {cpp:func}`~BTextView::SetRunArray()`, storing the result as a
{cpp:enumerator}`B_RAW_TYPE`. As with the "Text" property, the values
specifying the range are given in byte rather than character offsets. The
range counts towards the end of the text, even for
{cpp:enumerator}`B_REVERSE_RANGE_SPECIFIER`.

{hclass}`BTextView`.

-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_SET_PROPERTY`

	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_RANGE_SPECIFIER`,
{cpp:enumerator}`B_REVERSE_RANGE_SPECIFIER`
