# BShelf

A {cpp:class}`BShelf` is an object that you "attach" to a view in order to
make the view accept dropped {cpp:class}`BDragger` objects. In user-talk, a
shelf receives and displays replicants. Attaching a {cpp:class}`BShelf` to
a view (called the "container" view) is remarkably simple:

:::{code}
BShelf *shelf = new BShelf(container_view);
:::

That's all there is to it: With this single line of code, container_view
is primed to accept and (automatically) display dropped replicants. A
dropped replicant becomes a child of the container view. The container view
itself can be any {cpp:class}`BView` objectâ€”you don't alter the view in any
way, or even tell it that it's going to be a container.

:::{admonition} Note
:class: note
Attaching a shelf to a view is performed by the {cpp:class}`BShelf`
constructor only. You can't create a {cpp:class}`BShelf` and then decide
which view you want it to serve.

## Dropping into the View Hierarchy

When the user drops a replicant on a container view, the view receives a
{cpp:enum}`B_ARCHIVED_OBJECT` message that contains a {cpp:class}`BDragger`
and the dragger's target (a {cpp:class}`BView`). These two views (the
{cpp:class}`BDragger` and its target) are related as parent-child,
child-parent, or as siblings (as explained in the {cpp:class}`BDragger`
class). The "more elderly" of the two objects is added as a child of the
container view; if they're siblings, the two objects are both added as
children.

You can also send or post {cpp:enum}`B_ARCHIVED_OBJECT` messages to a
{cpp:class}`BShelf` to simulate a drag and drop.
