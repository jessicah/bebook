# BPoint

{cpp:class}`BPoint` objects represent points on a two-dimensional
coordinate grid. The object's coordinates are stored as public x and y data
members. The {cpp:class}`BPoint` class declares a global object,
{cpp:enum}`B_ORIGIN`, that represents (0,0).

For an overview of coordinate geometry for the BeOS, see "{ref}`The
Coordinate Space`".
