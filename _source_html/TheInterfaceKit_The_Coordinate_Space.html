To locate screens, windows, and views, draw in them, and report where the
cursor is positioned, it's necessary to have some conventional way of
talking about the display surface. The same conventions are used whether
the display device is a monitor that shows images on a screen or a
printer that puts them on a page.
</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><hr /><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_The_Coordinate_Space_Two_Dimensional_Coordinates"></a>Two-Dimensional Coordinates</h3></div></div></div><p>
In Be software, the display surface is described by a two-dimensional
coordinate system where y-coordinate values are greater towards the
bottom of the display and smaller towards the top, x-coordinate values
are greater to the right and smaller to the left:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords1.png" alt="Two Dimensional Co-Oridnate Space" /></div><p>
All quantities and distances are measured by floating-point values of the
type float.
</p><p>
A single coordinate unit is 1/72 of an inch, roughly equal to a
typographical point. However, all screens are considered to have a
resolution of 72 pixels per inch (regardless of the actual dimension), so
coordinate units actually count screen pixels. In other words, one unit
is the distance between the centers of adjacent pixels on-screen.
</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_The_Coordinate_Space_Coordinate_Systems"></a>Coordinate Systems</h4></div></div></div><p>
Specific coordinate systems are associated with the screen, with windows,
and with the views inside windows. They differ only in where the two axes
are located:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The global or screen coordinate system has its origin, (0.0, 0.0), at
the left top corner of the main screen. It's used for positioning
windows on-screen, for arranging multiple screens connected to the same
machine, and for comparing coordinate values that weren't originally
stated in a common coordinate system. (Multiple screens are not
currently supported.)
</p></li><li><p>
A window coordinate system has its origin at the left top corner of
the content area of a window. It's used principally for positioning
views within the window. Each window has its own coordinate system so
that locations within the window can be specified without regard to
where the window happens to be on-screen.
</p></li><li><p>
A view coordinate system has its default origin at the left top
corner of the view rectangle. However, scrolling can shift view
coordinates and move the origin. View-specific coordinates are used for
all drawing operations and to report the cursor location in most system
messages.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_The_Coordinate_Space_Coordinate_Data_Types"></a>Coordinate Data Types</h4></div></div></div><p>
The Interface Kit defines a handful of basic classes for locating points
and areas within a coordinate system:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
A <a class="link" href="BPoint.html" title="BPoint"><code class="classname">BPoint</code></a>
object is the simplest way to specify a coordinate location.
Each object stores two values—an x-coordinate and a
y-coordinate—that together locate a specific point, (x, y),
within a given coordinate system.
</p></li><li><p>
A <a class="link" href="BRect.html" title="BRect"><code class="classname">BRect</code></a> object
represents a rectangle; it's the simplest way to
designate an area within a coordinate system. The
<a class="link" href="BRect.html" title="BRect"><code class="classname">BRect</code></a> class defines a
rectangle as a set of four coordinate values—corresponding to the
rectangle's left, top, right, and bottom edges, as shown in this
illustration:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords2.png" alt="Rectangle Co-Oridnates" /></div></li><li><p>
The sides of the rectangle are therefore parallel to the coordinate
axes. The left and right sides delimit the range of x-coordinate values
within the rectangle, and the top and bottom sides delimit the range of
y-coordinate values. For example, if a rectangle's left top corner is
at (0.8, 2.7) and its right bottom corner is at (11.3, 49.5), all
points having x-coordinates ranging from 0.8 through 11.3 and
ycoordinates from 2.7 through 49.5 lie inside the rectangle.
</p></li><li><p>
If the top of a rectangle is the same as its bottom, or its left the
same as its right, the rectangle defines a straight line. If the top
and bottom are the same and also the left and right, it collapses to a
single point. Such rectangles are still valid—they specify real
locations within a coordinate system. However, if the top is greater
than the bottom or the left greater than the right, the rectangle is
invalid; it has no meaning.
</p></li><li><p>
A <a class="link" href="BPolygon.html" title="BPolygon"><code class="classname">BPolygon</code></a> object represents a polygon, a closed figure with an
arbitrary number of sides. The polygon is defined as an ordered set of
points. It encloses the area that would be outlined by connecting the
points in order, then connecting the first and last points to close the
figure. Each point is therefore a potential vertex of the polygon.
</p></li><li><p>
A <a class="link" href="BRegion.html" title="BRegion"><code class="classname">BRegion</code></a> object defines a set of points. A region can be any shape
and even include discontinuous areas. It's equivalent to a set of
rectangles.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><hr /><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id542079"></a>Mapping Coordinates to Pixels</h3></div></div></div><p>
The device-independent coordinate space described above must be mapped to
the pixel grid of a particular display device—the screen, a
printer, or some other piece of hardware that's capable of rendering an
image. For example, to display a rectangle, it's necessary to find the
pixel columns that correspond to its right and left sides and the pixel
rows that correspond to its top and bottom.
</p><p>
This depends entirely on the resolution of the device. In essence, each
device-independent coordinate value must be translated internally to a
device-dependent value—an integer index to a particular column or
row of pixels. In the coordinate space of the device, one unit equals one
pixel.
</p><p>
This translation is easy for the screen, since, as mentioned above,
there's a one-to-one correspondence between coordinate units and pixels.
It reduces to rounding floating-point coordinates to integers. For other
devices, however, the translation means first scaling the coordinate
value to a device-specific value, then rounding. For example, the point
(12.3, 40.8) would translate to (12, 41) on the screen, but to (51, 170)
on a 300 dpi printer.
</p><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id542115"></a>Screen Pixels</h4></div></div></div><p>
To map coordinate locations to device-specific pixels, you need to know
only two things:
</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li><p>
The resolution of the device
</p></li><li><p>
The location of the coordinate axes relative to pixel boundaries
</p></li></ul><p>
The axes are located in the same place for all devices: The x-axis runs
left to right along the middle of a row of pixels, and the y-axis runs
down the middle of a pixel column. They meet at the very center of a
pixel.
</p><p>
Because coordinate units match pixels on the screen, this means that all
integral coordinate values (those without a fractional part) fall midway
across a screen pixel. The following illustration shows where various
x-coordinate values fall on the x-axis. The broken lines represent the
division of the screen into a pixel grid:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords3.png" alt="Pixel on Grid" /></div><p>
As this illustration shows, it's possible to have coordinate values that
lie on the boundary between two pixels. The next section describes how
these values are mapped to one pixel or the other.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="TheInterfaceKit_The_Coordinate_Space_Picking_Pixels"></a>Picking Pixels to Stroke and Fill</h4></div></div></div><p>
This section discusses how the various <a class="link" href="BView.html" title="BView"><code class="classname">BView</code></a>
<code class="methodname">Stroke…()</code> and <code class="methodname">Fill…()</code>
functions pick specific pixels to color. (Since pixels are small, this is
not a topic that you necessarily need to be concerned about, especially
as you begin programming for the BeOS.)
</p><p>
Pixels are chosen after the pen size and all coordinate values have been
translated to device-specific units. Device-specific values measure
distances by counting pixels; 1 unit equals 1 pixel on the device.
</p><p>
A device-specific value can be derived from a coordinate value using a
formula that takes the size of a coordinate unit and the resolution of
the device into account. For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting example cpp"><code class="varname">device_value</code> = <code class="varname">coordinate_value</code> * ( <code class="varname">dpi</code>/ 72 )</pre><p>
<code class="varname">dpi</code> is the resolution of the device in dots (pixels) per inch, 72 is the
number of coordinate units in an inch, and <code class="varname">device_value</code> is rounded to the
closest integer.
</p><p>
To describe where lines and shapes fall on the pixel grid, this section
mostly talks about pixel units rather than coordinate units. The
accompanying illustrations magnify the grid so that pixel boundaries are
clear. As a consequence, they can show only very short lines and small
shapes. By blowing up the image, they exaggerate the phenomena they
illustrate.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id542268"></a>Stroking Thin Lines</h4></div></div></div><p>
The thinnest possible line is drawn when the pen size translates to 1
pixel on the device. Setting the size to 0.0 coordinate units guarantees
a 1-pixel pen on all devices.
</p><p>
A 1-pixel pen follows the path of the line it strokes and makes the line
exactly 1 pixel thick at all points. If the line is perfectly horizontal
or vertical, it touches just one row or one column of pixels, as
illustrated below. (The grid of broken lines shows the separation of the
display surface into pixels.)
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords4.png" alt="Drawing A Line" /></div><p>
Only pixels that the line path actually passes through are colored to
display the line. If a path begins or ends on a pixel boundary, as it
does for examples (a) and (b) in the illustration, the pixels at the
boundary aren't colored unless the path crosses into the pixel. The pen
touches the fewest possible number of pixels.
</p><p>
A line path that doesn't enter any pixels, but lies entirely on the
boundaries between pixels, colors the pixel row beneath it or the pixel
column to its right, as illustrated by lines (f) and (g). A path that
reduces to a single point lying on the corner of four pixels, as does
(h), colors the pixel at its lower right. (However, currently, it's
indeterminate which column or row of adjacent pixels would be used to
display vertical and horizontal lines like (f) and (g). Point (h) would
not be visible.)
</p><p>
1-pixel lines that aren't exactly vertical or horizontal touch just one
pixel per row or one per column. If the line is more vertical than
horizontal, only one pixel in each row is used to color the line. If the
line is more horizontal than vertical, only one pixel in each column is
used. Some illustrations of slanted 1-pixel thick lines are given below:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords5.png" alt="Slanted Lines" /></div><p>
Although a 1-pixel pen touches only pixels that lie on the path it
strokes, it won't touch every pixel that the path crosses if that would
mean making the line thicker than specified. When the path cuts though
two pixels in a column or row, but only one of those pixels can be
colored, the one that contains more of the path (the one that contains
the midpoint of the segment cut by the column or row) is chosen. This is
illustrated in the following close-up, which shows where a mostly
vertical line crosses one row of pixels:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords6.png" alt="Close Up Of Slanted Lines" /></div><p>
However, before a choice is made as to which pixel in a row or column to
color, the line path is normalized for the device. For example, if a line
is defined by two endpoints, it's first determined which pixels
correspond to those endpoints. The line path is then treated as if it
connected the centers of those pixels. This may alter which pixels get
colored, as is illustrated below. In this illustration, the solid black
line is the line path as originally specified and the broken line is its
normalized version:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords7.png" alt="Original And Normalized Lines" /></div><p>
This normalization is nothing more than the natural consequence of the
rounding that occurs when coordinate values are translated to
device-specific pixel values.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id542384"></a>Stroking Curved Lines</h4></div></div></div><p>
Although all the diagrams above show straight lines, the principles they
illustrate apply equally to curved line paths. A curved path can be
treated as if it were made up of a large number of short straight
segments.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id542399"></a>Filling and Stroking Rectangles</h4></div></div></div><p>
The following illustration shows how some rectangles, represented by the
solid black line, would be filled with a solid color.
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords8.png" alt="Filling And Stroking Rectangles" /></div><p>
A rectangle includes every pixel that it encloses and every pixel that
its sides pass through. However, as rectangle (q) illustrates, it doesn't
include pixels that its sides merely touch at the boundary.
</p><p>
If the pixel grid in this illustration represents the screen, rectangle
(q) would have left, top, right, and bottom coordinates with fractional
values of .5. Rectangle (n), on the other hand, would have coordinates
without any fractional parts. Nonfractional coordinates lie at the center
of screen pixels.
</p><p>
Rectangle (n), in fact, is the normalized version of all four of the
illustrated rectangles. It shows how the sides of the four rectangles
would be translated to pixel values. Note that for a rectangle like (q),
with edges that fall on pixel boundaries, normalization means rounding
the left and top sides upward and rounding the right and bottom sides
downward. This follows from the principal that the fewest possible number
of pixels should be colored.
</p><p>
Although the four rectangles above differ in size and shape, when filled
they all cover a 6 * 4 pixel area. You can't predict this area from the
dimensions of the rectangle. Because the coordinate space is continuous
and x and y values can be located anywhere, rectangles with different
dimensions might have the same rendered size, as shown above, and
rectangles with the same dimensions might have different rendered sizes,
as shown below:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords9.png" alt="Same Sized Rectangles, Different Display Size" /></div><p>
If a one-pixel pen strokes a rectangular path, it touches only pixels
that would be included if the rectangle were filled. The illustration
below shows the same rectangles that were presented above, but strokes
them rather than fills them:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords10.png" alt="Rectangles As Above But Stroked" /></div><p>
Each of the rectangles still covers a 6 * 4 pixel area. Note that even
though the path of rectangle (q) lies entirely on pixel boundaries,
pixels below it and to its right are not touched by the pen. The pen
touches only pixels that lie within the rectangle.
</p><p>
If a rectangle collapses to a straight line or to a single point, it no
longer contains any area. Stroking or filling such a rectangle is
equivalent to stroking the line path with a one-pixel pen, as was
discussed in the previous section.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id542518"></a>Filling and Stroking Polygons</h4></div></div></div><p>
The figure below shows a polygon as it would be stroked by a one-pixel
pen and as it would be filled:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords11.png" alt="Filling And Stroking Polygons" /></div><p>
The same rules apply when stroking each segment of a polygon as would
apply if that segment were an independent line. Therefore, the pen may
not touch every pixel the segment passes through.
</p><p>
When the polygon is filled, no additional pixels around its border are
colored. As is the case for a rectangle, the displayed shape of filled
polygon is identical to the shape of the polygon when stroked with a
one-pixel pen. The pen doesn't touch any pixels when stroking the polygon
that aren't colored when the polygon is filled. Conversely, filling
doesn't color any pixels at the border of the polygon that aren't touched
by a one-pixel pen.
</p></div><div class="section"><div xmlns="" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="titlepage"><div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="id542564"></a>Stroking Thick Lines</h4></div></div></div><p>
A pen that's thicker than one pixel touches the same pixels that a
one-pixel pen does, but it adds extra columns and rows adjacent to the
line path. A thick pen tip is, in effect, a linear brush that's held
perpendicular to the line path and kept centered on the line. The
illustration below shows two short lines, each five pixels thick:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/TheInterfaceKit/coords12.png" alt="Stroking Thick Lines" /></div><p>
The thickness or a vertical or horizontal line can be measured in an
exact number of pixels. When the line is slanted, as it is for (t) above,
the stroking algorithm tries to make the line visually approximate the
thickness of a vertical or horizontal line. In this way, lines retain
their shape even when rotated.
</p><p>
When a rectangle is stroked with a thick pen, the corners of the
rectangle are filled in, as shown in the example below:
